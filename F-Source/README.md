### What it is

F-Source is a big part for F-Ping's Launcher functionality, since this is the main source that the launcher connects to, made specially this way so the launcher can get the latest updates launched, and to update the launcher without having to make thousands of releases.

 ### Disclaimer


**This is not meant for public purposes, it's meant for a free hosting source that the launcher can lead on**
